# Pattern Matching Algorithms Comparison

## Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook provides an experimental comparison of three popular pattern matching algorithms: Brute Force, Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), and Boyer-Moore. The primary focus is on evaluating the performance of these algorithms in terms of speed when applied to large text documents with patterns of varying lengths.

## Setup

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib (for plotting)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the notebook directory:

```bash
