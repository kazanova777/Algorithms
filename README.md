Pattern matching is a fundamental operation in computer science and is commonly used in various applications, such as text processing, data mining, and bioinformatics. The goal of this project is to perform an experimental comparison of three popular pattern-matching algorithms: brute force, Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), and Boyer-Moore. The focus is on evaluating their relative speeds when applied to large text documents with varying-length patterns.
